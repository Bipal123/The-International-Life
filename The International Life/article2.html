		<p>With colleges across the United States shutting down due to COVID-19, most students have returned to their home. However, there are a number of kids, me being one of them, who chose to “monitor” the situation and are now in an awkward position.</p>
		<p>As for myself, I was at Louisiana over spring break, when my university decided that it is going to close down for the rest of the semester. I thought to myself, “Oh well! Might as well go back to home now.” However, as fate would have it, the government of Nepal decided to close down our country’s international airport on the same day.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, the governor of Ohio also decided to impose a statewide lockdown very soon, which meant that my university was closing down all of its buildings, including the dorm where I was staying over at, and had requested everyone to move out as soon as possible unless we could get a waiver to stay. With no chance of returning back to my home country and the university kicking out most students, it was natural that I had panicked.</p>
		<p>My best friend had tagged along with me on this trip. Unlike me, she calmly assessed the situation and suggested that we should both try to find a place to stay over in Louisiana itself. Since I didn’t think that travelling back to Ohio at this time would be the safest thing to do, I agreed.</p>
		<p>After talking to many other Nepalese students living over here, we were finally able to find a landlord who was willing to provide us with a small apartment on a month-to-month lease.</p>
		<p>Since we both thought that this would only be a weeklong trip, we didn’t bring anything expect a few pairs of clothes each. So, the next step for us was to buy stuff for our new place. We went to the nearest Walmart and started buying everything: snacks, vegetables, rice, spices, condiments, utensils, washroom supplies, towels. This is probably the one and only time that I went inside a store and came out with a literal full cart that had no more space for anything.</p>
		<p>After some days, the excitement of living in a new place wore off. Now, it is a constant battle between my desire to watch the next episode of Hunter x Hunter or completing an assignment for college. All that I can now do is wait and see what happens.</p>
		<p>If there’s one thing that I have learned over the past month, it’s that no matter how much you plan things, life can always turn the tide. It’s important to go along with the flow and hope for the best.</p>
		<p>Stay safe and healthy out there, my wonderful reader!</p>
