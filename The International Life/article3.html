		<p>As someone who is young and just getting into adulthood, one thing that I didn’t anticipate learning about was money. You see, college is the first time that I actually have some real cash. Back home, I’d usually ask for pocket change whenever I used to go out and my parents would take care of all other major expenses.</p>
		<p>But college is a different story altogether. I had a bunch of expenses that I was responsible for myself. This included college tuition, rent, books, and so much more. I had to learn how to manage all of them and I needed to learn it fast. Along the way, I picked up some helpful tips that I’m now going to present to you guys.</p>
		<dl>
		<dt>1. Get a part time job:</dt>
		<dd>There are plenty of part time jobs that are available on campus and they can be a great means to pay your monthly rent and other small expenses. As for myself, I became a service desk IT assistant at our business college.</dd>
		<dt>2. Figure out where your money is going:</dt>
		<dd>Get into the habit of going through your bank’s monthly statement and see what things you are spending on. As for myself, I decided to categorize all of my expenses. This is what it looked like for January 2020:
			<table class="center" style="display: table;">
				<tr>
					<th>Name</th>
					<th>Amount</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>College</td>
					<td>$18.73</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Food and Groceries</td>
					<td>$215.99</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Travel</td>
					<td>$86.97</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Shopping</td>
					<td>$37.45</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</dd>
		<dt>3. Create a budget and stick to it:</dt>
		<dd>Once you see where your money is going, you might want to cut back a little and start saving up. Instead of buying that Starbucks coffee every day, you can choose to save those 3 dollars, which can really add up in the long run.</dd>
		<dt>4. Never miss a payment on your credit card:</dt>
		<dd>Get into the habit of only buying things that you can afford to pay in full by the end of the month. Getting into credit card debt early can be you digging your own grave. The interests can slowly add up and will haunt you for a long time. So, always make sure that you pay your credit card bills on time and never miss a single payment.</dd>
