		<p>For a kid from a small south Asian country, the United States of America had always been a dreamy place in my eyes. Most of what I knew about the US came from watching, often excessively, televised shows and movies from Hollywood. For 16-year-old me, located thousands of miles away from home, the United States seemed distant at best.</p>
		<p>After clearing many hurdles, from taking the SAT to rigorously researching and applying to different colleges, when it was finally decided that I would be going to a college in the US, the prospect of travelling so far away was exhilarating.</p>
		<p>The day before my trip, I was sad with the thoughts of leaving my home, but also excited with the thoughts of the huge airplanes that I’d board, all the new people I’d see, and the grand airports that I’d explore. I could barely sleep. Before that day, the longest that I had been in an airplane was a little bit less than 2 hours when visiting New Delhi in neighboring India.</p>
		<p>Next day, my flight was supposed to depart at 3 PM. Having an Asian dad, we arrived at the airport 3 hours early. After saying final goodbyes, I went inside, checked in my luggage, and went through immigration to wait for my flight.</p> 
		<p>After some time, I got inside my Qatar Airways flight to Doha. However, I fell asleep very quickly inside the plane; my choice to not sleep the day before was going to make my life a living hell. I only woke up a few minutes before landing, feeling extremely tired. On top of that, I had developed an annoying pain on my shoulders as well.</p> 
		<p>When I arrived at Hamad International Airport, ranked one of the best airports in the entire world, I crashed at the airport’s “quiet rooms” to rest. I only woke up before an hour before my next destination: Boston. To this day, I regret not being able to explore as much as I would have loved to.</p>
		<p>Although I was feeling a little bit better, my shoulder pain hadn’t left me. The fact that I was carrying a bulky backpack and an additional carry on didn’t help as well. I slept through most of my 14-hour journey to Boston as well. After arriving and checking to the domestic terminal, I learned that my next flight had been postponed and I’d have to wait another 10 hours. At that point, I couldn’t wait for the trip, one which I had been looking forward to for such a long time, to be over.</p>
		<p>Finally, after travelling for more than 40 hours and being completely exhausted, I felt, for the first time, that this journey isn’t going to be as easy as I had thought it to be.</p>
