			<p>When international students such as myself and particularly other Nepalese students apply to the universities in the US, the only thing that comes into our minds are about colleges and academics. We donâ€™t really give much thought to the location that we'd be spending our nect 4 years in or ways to deal with the eventual homesickness that strikes us. Even though choosing a college based on their academic strength is important, I firmly believe that we also need to give some thoughts to other aspects of being a college student that come along with it as well. This is the main reason why "The International Life", a small blog that talks about numerous small day to day things that I go through being an international student in the United States, was created by me. I hope that you enjoy reading through it as much as I enjoyed creating it for YOU. </p>
